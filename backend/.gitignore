# --- Configuration files (sensitive - be VERY careful what you ignore here) ---
# Ideally, sensitive config should be handled via environment variables or external config
# and NOT committed to Git.
# If you have files with passwords or API keys, ensure they are NOT tracked.
# Example (be cautious and review!):
# application.properties  # If it contains sensitive data (better to use environment vars)
# application.yml       # Same as above
# secrets.properties    # Example for a dedicated secrets file (should DEFINITELY not be committed)

# --- OS specific files ---
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# --- Other possible ignores (adjust to your project) ---
# node_modules/      # If you have frontend assets and Node.js
# webapp/dist/       # If you build frontend assets into a dist folder
# documentation/     # If you generate project documentation
# reports/           # If you generate reports (e.g., test reports)
# coverage/          # If you generate code coverage reports

# --- Custom ignores ---
# Add any project-specific files or directories you want to ignore here.
# For example:
# local-config.xml
# my-private-data/

# --- Keep important project files tracked (explicitly un-ignore if needed) ---
# Example: If you accidentally ignored a specific configuration file
# !src/main/resources/important-config.xml
